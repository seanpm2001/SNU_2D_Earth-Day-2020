# SNU_2D_Earth-Day-2020
The old 2020 Earth day repository for SNU. Obsolete, it is kept for historical purposes. The 2019 and 2020 versions were superceded by the official Earth day page that is now updated yearly instead of a new version being made every year. Remember to follow the SNU build guidelines: https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/745564a46186888e829fdeb9cda584de
